<div className="min-w-[320px]">
  {/* Your content here */}
</div>



- why this doesn't work? from-[#61aaf8] to-[#4a8ee6]

To create a gradient background using Tailwind CSS, you need to use the bg-gradient-to class along with the from-[color] and to-[color] classes. 


- in tailwind can I have something like this to change flex orientation : flex-column md-flex-row

<div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row">
  <!-- Content here -->
</div>
